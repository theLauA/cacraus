This is meant to be a simple static website where information are presented to the viewer in a straight forward fashion (defintely not because of my lack of knowledge on JavaScript/JQ).

- Got the digitalized logo from YuanFei, the designer, so I updated the logo picture for the website and finally added in tab icon. "Accidentally" find a bug where the menu bar won't follow while scored horizontallly since this is how fixed position works.

- Solved the menu bar problem by changing it to absolute position, however I still want the effect of fixed position. After some research(Google), it seems that "sticky" value for position would be a quick fix but google doesn't support that value anymore.

- Found some JavaScript/JQ solutions, it took a while for me to realize I need to import JQ to use JQ, but anyway most of them seems to be too complex for the situation, so I settled with a method that is similar to those annoying floating ads that follow you forever (Changing the "top" value when scrolling vertically).
